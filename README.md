# 🐍 My Python Studies

This repository will contain exercises, examples, and small projects developed during the Python course by Geek University on Udemy.

Although I'm already familiar with general programming concepts (especially from Java), this course will help me solidify Python syntax and idioms.

## 📚 Topics to be covered
- Variables and data types
- Functions and modules
- Conditionals and loops
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Exceptions

## 🚧 Status
Currently setting up the structure — exercises will be added as I progress through the course.

## 🧰 Tools
- Python 3.x
- PyCharm or any editor of choice

## 📜 License
